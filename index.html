        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
        <p>My name is Jasmine Xu and I am a dietetics student at McGill University. I was born and raised in Montreal, although I have been traveling back and forth to Macau every Summer to work at a water-based circus show called The House of Dancing Water. 

        </p>
        <p>I enjoy listening to all kinds of genres of music. I grew up being classically trained in piano performance before putting most of my time into mastering the Erhu, a chinese violin.
            What I find really interesting in the world of music is how varied, limitless and creative it is. People might think that music is mainly just categorized into different genres, but we often forget how unique traditional music from each country is, including their scales, notation and instruments.
